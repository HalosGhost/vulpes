This small program, based on a similar program by Jesse McClure, will output text based on the status of various system components. It is meant to be interpreted and formatted by `Alopex <http://trilbywhite.github.io/alopex/>`_ (another work by Jesse McClure).

The values used in this program are specific to my hardware. Though they may be easily fixable for other computers, the source will almost certainly need to be edited.
